This is a project focused on exploring the use of Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (ZkSNARKs) to enable privacy-preserving machine learning.

# Introduction
Machine learning algorithms often require access to sensitive data in order to train models, such as medical records or financial information. This presents a challenge for individuals and organizations that want to protect the privacy of this data. Traditional approaches to privacy protection, such as data anonymization or encryption, may not be sufficient for some applications.

ZkSNARKs are a cryptographic tool that can be used to prove the validity of a computation without revealing any of the inputs or intermediate steps. This makes them an attractive solution for privacy-preserving machine learning, as they allow data to be kept private while still enabling the training of accurate models.

# Project Goals
The primary goal of this project is to investigate the use of ZkSNARKs for privacy-preserving machine learning. Specifically, we aim to:

Develop a deep understanding of ZkSNARKs and their applications in machine learning
Implement a proof-of-concept system for privacy-preserving machine learning using ZkSNARKs.


# Implementation
We have developed a proof-of-concept system that uses ZkSNARKs to enable privacy-preserving machine learning. This will involve selecting an appropriate machine learning algorithm and dataset, and developing the necessary cryptographic primitives to ensure privacy.
We have selected MNIST dataset for displaying the proof of concept.


# Conclusion
Privacy-preserving machine learning is an important area of research, and the use of ZkSNARKs has the potential to enable new and innovative approaches to protecting sensitive data. Our project will contribute to this area by developing a proof-of-concept system which will provide a strategy to perform privacy preserving machine learning using ZK-SNARKs.
